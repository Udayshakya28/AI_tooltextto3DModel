# AI_tooltextto3DModel

---

## Project Structure

This project primarily consists of the following core files:

### 1. `main.py`
This file contains the core backend logic for processing text input and generating 3D models. It serves as the heart of the AI pipeline, handling model inference, data processing, and any computational tasks required to convert text descriptions into 3D representations.

### 2. `streamlit_app.py`
This file provides the interactive user interface using Streamlit. It enables users to input their text descriptions and visualize the generated 3D models in a user-friendly web environment. The app communicates with the backend logic in `main.py` to deliver real-time results.

Both files are integral parts of the larger AI_tooltextto3DModel system, allowing for end-to-end functionality from user input to 3D model output.

do these changes in the previous file or replace them then the project will run very nicely

Would you like any further customization or technical detail for each file?
